  "problem": {
    "title": "Space has a power problem",
    "body": "Most missions still depend on isolated generation and storage at each asset. That drives up subsystem mass and integration complexity, limits payload, and creates downtime when demand peaks or sunlight drops. Space operations need power delivered across networks, not trapped in local budgets."
