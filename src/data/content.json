  "vision": {
    "title": "Build the power backbone of the space economy",
    "body": "Our vision is a modular energy platform that scales from single spacecraft missions to persistent multi-node orbital infrastructure. We are focused on precision power delivery, robust thermal and RF performance, and production-ready architecture."

  "problem": {
    "title": "Space missions are constrained by fragile power assumptions",
    "body": "Existing systems often trade reliability, transmission efficiency, or integration speed. As orbital operations become continuous and distributed, power has to move from a subsystem to a strategic capability with higher endurance, tighter control loops, and mission-adaptive redundancy."

    "title": "Transmission-led architecture with system-level control",
    "body": "NeoWatt combines high-integrity power electronics, transmission-aware design, and software-assisted operational control. The result is a platform engineered for predictable performance in dynamic orbital conditions.",
